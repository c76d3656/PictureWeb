# PictureWeb
## a website only show picture

 **only suppose `png`**
 
 picture in `images` must sort by `number`!  
 ```
    images include:  
    such as:  
    1.png  
    2.png  
    3.png  
    ...  
    bash.sh
 ```  
- the `bash.sh` in images is to get how many pictures+1 in the `images`
- the `bash.sh` outside is to batch renaming filename and it's extension automatically
